# PERSONAL BLOG

Timeline:19/1/23---10/2/23

I have created a Personal Blog where I can add blog contents and do some other necessary operations with those. Here basically, I have given the facility to Create,Read,Update the blogs from the custom Dashboard. The delete operation is currently can be done from Django-admin pannel (as it is currently a personal blog project, so I have not focused so much about delete operations in a customized manner, later on if I turn this project into a public blog, I may add this priviledge along with some more!!)
