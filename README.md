# PARTHIB-WRITES (Personal Blog)
- 🖋️ This is My First Full Stack Project Using Django and TailwindCSS. Its V1 was created during Feb-2023. But at that stage It was Not so much featureful 😕.
  
- 🌝 So I thought to recreate the project.

- 🌟 Let's have a look on the feature differences.
  
| Features     | V1     | V2 |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Django-Tailwind Packadge | Yes     | No (Will manually do)   |
| Emailing    | No  | Yes (Trying to add by third party service)   |
| Authentication   | No  | Yes (Trying to do add Native, May add Third Party auth also)  |
| Payment Gateway | No  | Yes (Trying to do add Third Party services)  |

- 🍒 Development Addon - Will Provide REST APIs to connect it with any other microservices ,  Trying to implement Testing 🧪 🧪.

- 🛢️In V1, I used SQLITE as its database . But , Now I planned to use Postgresql.
